# About Author: I'm a good Client/Server Developer in Visual Basic #
#               and currently learning C/C++, but enough to fix or #
#               edit C/C++ code to make it kinda better or fixed ;)#
#                                                                  #
#               That's  all I have  to say, I don't  have anything #
#               really interesting to say, but  that I do  like to #
#               work with Red Hat linux OSs for internet stuff and #
#               that I love programming every day, almost 24/7 ;D  #
#                                                                  #

# Cloak 'em will make almost any windows and  dialogs  transparent #
# that you want and it also make the windows and  dialogs that are #
# transparent become normal dialogs again.  Cloak 'em  also  comes #
# with  code  on how  to do  a great cloak and decloak transparent #
# effect that can be used on  slpash screens  and about dialogs or #
# even a theme for the project it's self.  Making windows cloak as #
# they are being closed and decloak as they are showing up.        #
#                                                                  #

# The project Cloak 'em was created  just because I wanted to post #
# something that would be very useful and  productive to those who #
# use Planet Source Code allot and PSC  has helped me  learn allot #
# about Visual Basic and how  to  develop very stable code just by # 
# seeing how programs are functioning thru code. I've learned allot#
# from PSC and those of you who have posted some interesting code. #
#                                                                  #
# So I  decided  to look around and  see what apps were popular on #
# PSC and I saw that people are really interested in the new Win2k #
# API that made windows transparent and look neat.  So I  was just #
# looking around and found some code laying around on my HardDrive #
# that's  always been  there that I haven't really looked at much. #
#                                                                  #
# Then I noticed I had allot of code about the  transparent effect #
# that Windows 2000  can do,  so I just  stuck code togather along #
# with the  C++  button style code  to really give the GUI a great #
# look and feel along with the effects it can do.  So I just clean #
# and edited the source codes so make it very simple to understand #
# and very easy to port the code to other people's projects.       #
#                                                                  #
# Well, Enjoy the project and I hope next time to release something#
# that I think  allot  of people have been waiting  for which will #
# make people very happy to have, edit, and use in their projects. #
#                                                                  #
# How about I release a IRCd source code completly  written in VB6 #
#and uses no IRC controls, but for Net connection and DNS resolving#
# since MS can't make any good nor useful controls that are worth  #
# messing with which is a pain in the butt.   Anyway,  I  will see #
# about stripping code from my big project which is an IRC Server  #
# and it is loaded with features to a standardized IRCd kinda like #
# wIRCd(DreamForge), but this source code will be in VB and I hope #
# that most of you who use PSC will really enjoy it.               #
#                                                                  #
